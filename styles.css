 * This file is where you can add custom CSS rules that will

 * * NOTE: For local development and proper PWA setup, you would 
 * normally configure a local build process (like PostCSS) to
 * generate this file automatically by importing Tailwind directives.
 * * Since we are using a CDN for the primary Tailwind CSS library 
 * in index.html, this file remains empty for now unless you 
 * need custom styles.
